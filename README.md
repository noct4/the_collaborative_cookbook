# the_collaborative_cookbook

A collection of recipes from all across the land.

Inside the resources folder there is a template which can be used to lay out all the recipes. 

For now there isn't any kind of GUI or anything, but using the tags and template there is the possibility of creating one down the line that features a search and other features.

If you would like to make a contribution tot he repo, feel free to make a PR!

Enjoy and feel free to use/contribute any recipes!
